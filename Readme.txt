This code solves the Poiseuille flow problem using a numerical method and compares the numerical solution with the analytical solution. The Poiseuille flow is the flow of a Newtonian fluid between two parallel plates. 

To run the code:
1. Open the MATLAB environment.
2. Copy the code and paste it into a new script.
3. Save the script as "poiseuille_flow.m".
4. Run the script.
5. Enter the number of grid points when prompted.

The code will generate a plot of the velocity profile in Poiseuille flow, comparing the analytical and numerical solutions. The plot includes a legend and axis labels.

The code requires the GaussElimination function to run, which is not included in this file.
